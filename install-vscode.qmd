title: "Install VS Code (Recommended)"
---

## Why VS Code?

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a professional, lightweight code editor used by developers worldwide. While RStudio handles R code well, VS Code is excellent for:

- Writing Python scripts for data analysis and automation
- Managing Git repositories and GitHub
- Working with multiple file types (R, Python, Markdown, JSON, etc.)
- Version control and collaboration
- Building a professional development workflow

**This is optional but highly recommended** if you plan to work with Python or want to explore coding beyond this course.

---

## System Requirements

- **Windows 10+, macOS 10.12+, or Linux** (most distributions)
- **At least 200 MB of disk space**
- Works on all computers that can run R and RStudio

---

## Step 1: Download VS Code

1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Click the large **"Download"** button
3. Select your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Choose "Windows (64-bit)" or "Windows (32-bit)"
   - **macOS**: Choose based on your processor (Intel or Apple Silicon)
   - **Linux**: Choose your distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, etc.)

---

## Step 2: Install VS Code

### For Windows

1. Run the downloaded `.exe` file
2. Click "I accept the agreement" → **Next**
3. Choose installation location (default is fine) → **Next**
4. Click through all remaining options → **Install**
5. Click **Finish**

### For macOS

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file

sudo apt install code
```

---

## Step 3: First Launch

When you open VS Code for the first time:

1. You'll see a Welcome tab
2. The interface has:
   - **Left Sidebar**: File explorer, search, source control, extensions
   - **Editor (center)**: Where you write code
   - **Bottom Panel**: Terminal, debugging, problems
   - **Top Bar**: File, Edit, View, Run menus

---

## Step 4: Install Recommended Extensions

Extensions add functionality to VS Code. Here's what to install for this course:

### 1. Python (for data analysis)

1. Click the **Extensions icon** (left sidebar, looks like blocks)
2. Search for `Python`
3. Click the result by Microsoft
4. Click **Install**

This gives you Python code completion, debugging, and data analysis support.

### 2. R Extension (for R support in VS Code)

1. In Extensions, search for `R`
2. Install **R** by REditorSupport
3. When prompted, let it install supporting files

### 3. Git Graph (for version control)

1. Search for `Git Graph`
2. Install by mhutchie
3. This gives you a visual representation of your Git history

### 4. Prettier (for code formatting)

1. Search for `Prettier - Code formatter`
2. Install by Prettier
3. This automatically formats your code to professional standards

### Optional: Markdown Preview Enhanced

If you want a live preview of Markdown files:

1. Search for `Markdown Preview Enhanced`
2. Install by Yiyi Wang

## Step 5: Connect to GitHub

If you created a GitHub account (from our GitHub setup guide), you can integrate it with VS Code:

1. Click the **Source Control icon** (left sidebar, branch symbol)
2. Click **Sign in with GitHub**
3. Complete the authentication in your browser
4. Return to VS Code (it should be authorized)

Now you can:
- Clone repositories directly into VS Code
- View Git history visually
- Commit and push changes
- Manage GitHub issues and PRs

---

## Step 6: Create Your First Project

Let's create a simple project folder:

1. Click **File** → **Open Folder**
2. Create or select a folder (e.g., `~/Documents/mc451-code`)
3. Click **Select Folder**

You now have a workspace. Let's create a file:

1. Click the **New File** icon (top of the file explorer)
2. Name it `hello.py`
3. Type this Python code:

```python
# My first Python script
message = "Hello, Communication Liaison!"
print(message)
```

4. Press **Ctrl+S** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+S** (Mac) to save
5. Click the **Run** button (play icon, top right) or press **Ctrl+Shift+D**

You should see the output in the Terminal:
```
Hello, Communication Liaison!
```

---

## Step 7: Set Up an Integrated Terminal

VS Code has a built-in terminal (great for running Git commands):

1. Press **Ctrl+`** (backtick, below Escape key) or go to **View** → **Terminal**
2. The terminal opens at the bottom
3. You can now run:
   - `git status` to check your repository status
   - `python script.py` to run Python files
   - `R --vanilla` to start an R session
4. Type `exit` to close the terminal

## Step 8: Keyboard Shortcuts (Essential)

| Action | Windows/Linux | Mac |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Open file | Ctrl+O | Cmd+O |
| Save file | Ctrl+S | Cmd+S |
| Find text | Ctrl+F | Cmd+F |
| Replace | Ctrl+H | Cmd+H |
| Open terminal | Ctrl+` | Ctrl+` |
| Format document | Shift+Alt+F | Shift+Opt+F |
| Add comment | Ctrl+/ | Cmd+/ |
| Go to line | Ctrl+G | Cmd+G |

---

## Step 9: Clone a GitHub Repository

If you created a GitHub project, you can work on it in VS Code:

1. Click the **Source Control** icon (left sidebar)
2. Click **Clone Repository**
3. Paste your GitHub repo URL (from github.com)
4. Choose a folder to save it
5. Click **Open** when prompted

Your entire repository is now in VS Code, and you can edit, commit, and push changes.

2. **Create/edit files** in the editor
3. **Save your changes** (Ctrl+S)
4. **Open Terminal** (Ctrl+`)
5. **Check status**: `git status`
6. **Add changes**: `git add .`
7. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Update analysis script"`
8. **Push**: `git push`
9. **Verify on GitHub**: Go to github.com and refresh

## Common Issues & Fixes

### "Python not found"

**Problem**: VS Code can't find Python.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you installed Python (go back to your system settings)
2. In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
3. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
4. Choose your Python installation from the list

### Extensions Won't Install

**Problem**: You can't install an extension.

**Solution**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try uninstalling and reinstalling VS Code
3. Try installing the extension from the Extension Marketplace website instead

### Terminal Says "git: command not found"

**Problem**: Git isn't working in the terminal.

**Solution**: Make sure you installed Git (see our GitHub setup guide). Restart VS Code after installing.

## When to Use VS Code vs RStudio

| Task | Best Tool |
|------|-----------|
| Writing R code | RStudio (better for data analysis) |
| Writing Python code | VS Code (better for scripting) |
| Quick data analysis | RStudio |
| Automated data pipelines | VS Code |
| Managing Git | VS Code (more powerful tools) |
| Learning R | RStudio (more beginner-friendly) |

**Pro tip**: Use RStudio for analysis, VS Code for automation and version control!
