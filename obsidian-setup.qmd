## What is Obsidian?

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management app that stores all your files as plain markdown. You own your data—everything is stored locally on your computer, and you can sync it however you want (or not at all). This guide covers the basics and how to customize your workspace with plugins and themes.

---

## Step 1: Install Obsidian

1. Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
2. Click **Download** and choose your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Open Obsidian when installation is complete

---

## Step 2: Open Your First Vault

A **vault** is a folder that Obsidian manages. The Liaison Program provides a pre-configured vault.

### 2.1 Extract the Liaison Vault

1. Download **Liaison_Vault.zip** from the [Resources page](resources/)
2. Extract it to a location like:
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Liaison_Vault`
   - **Mac**: `~/Documents/Liaison_Vault`
   - **Linux**: `~/Documents/Liaison_Vault`

### 2.2 Open the Vault in Obsidian

1. Open Obsidian
2. Click **Open folder as vault**
3. Navigate to where you extracted `Liaison_Vault` and select it
4. Click **Open**

Obsidian will now show your vault with all the pre-configured folders and templates!

---

## Step 3: Navigate Your Vault

### The Sidebar

On the left side of Obsidian, you'll see:

- **File Explorer**: Shows all folders and files in your vault
- **Search**: Find notes by keyword
- **Starred**: Quick access to your favorite notes
- **Backlinks**: See how notes are connected

### The Ribbon (Left Edge)

The leftmost thin bar has icons for:
- Create new note
- Open vault settings
- View help

### The Main Editor

Click any note to open it and start writing. Notes are stored as `.md` (markdown) files.

---

## Step 4: Community Plugins

Obsidian has a large community that creates plugins to extend functionality. Here's how to install them.

### 4.1 Enable Community Plugins

By default, community plugins are disabled. To enable them:

1. Click the **Settings** icon (gear icon) in the bottom left
2. Go to **Community plugins**
3. Click **Turn on community plugins** (if it's greyed out, they're already on)

### 4.2 Install a Plugin: QMD as Markdown

The textbook chapters are in `.qmd` format (Quarto markdown). Obsidian doesn't recognize this format by default, but the **qmd as md** plugin fixes this.

**To install it:**

1. In Settings, go to **Community plugins**
2. Click **Browse** (or search icon)
3. Search for **"qmd as md"** (by Daniel Borek)
4. Click the result to open the plugin page
5. Click **Install**
6. Once installed, click **Enable** to turn it on

Now you can view and edit `.qmd` files just like regular markdown files!

### 4.3 Other Useful Plugins

Here are some community plugins that work great with the Liaison Program:

| Plugin | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Dataview** | Query and display your notes as databases/lists |
| **Calendar** | Visual calendar for journal entries |
| **Templater** | Advanced template features beyond Obsidian's built-in system |
| **Daily Notes** | Automatically create and link daily notes |
| **Task** | Advanced task management with due dates and status |
| **Excalidraw** | Draw diagrams and sketches within notes |

To install any of these, repeat steps 2-5 above with the plugin name.

## Step 5: Customize with Themes

Obsidian comes with a light and dark theme by default, but the community has created hundreds more. Here's how to change themes.

### 5.1 Access Themes

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon, bottom left)
2. Go to **Appearance**
3. Scroll to **Themes** section

### 5.2 Choose a Built-in Theme

Under "Manage", you'll see two built-in themes:
- **Default Light Theme**
- **Default Dark Theme** (recommended for long study sessions)

Click either to apply it immediately.

### 5.3 Install Community Themes

For custom themes from the community:

1. Make sure community plugins are enabled (see Step 4.1)
2. In **Appearance**, look for **Manage** button next to Themes
3. Click **Manage** (or the folder icon)
4. Click **Browse** in the top right
5. Search for a theme name (e.g., "Minimal", "Nord", "Dracula")
6. Click the theme to see a preview
7. Click **Install** and then **Use**

### 5.4 Popular Themes

Some community favorites:

- **Minimal** - Clean, distraction-free interface
- **Nord** - Cool blue color scheme, easy on the eyes
- **Dracula** - Dark theme with vibrant accent colors
- **Cybertron** - Modern, sleek design
- **Things** - Inspired by the Things app, very polished

Try a few and find what works best for you!

## Step 6: Essential Settings

### 6.1 File Management

In **Settings → Files & Links**:
- **Default location for new notes**: Choose where new notes appear (e.g., "Inbox" folder)
- **Show unsaved indicator**: Helpful to know when to save

### 6.2 Editor Settings

In **Settings → Editor**:
- **Strict line breaks**: Makes formatting more predictable
- **Line numbers**: Toggle on/off based on preference
- **Indent size**: Set to 2 or 4 spaces (2 is cleaner for markdown)

### 6.3 Hotkeys

In **Settings → Hotkeys**, you can set keyboard shortcuts for common actions:
- Toggle sidebar (great for focus mode)
- Create new note
- Search in vault
- Follow backlinks

### 6.4 Sync & Backup

In **Settings → About**, you'll see sync options:
- **Obsidian Sync** (paid): Cloud sync across devices
- **Git**: Use Git to version control your vault (recommended for this course!)
- **Manual backups**: Copy your vault folder regularly

For the Liaison Program, using **Git** is recommended so you can version control your work.

## Step 7: Basic Markdown Syntax

Notes in Obsidian use markdown. Here are the essentials:

| Syntax | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `# Heading 1` | Large heading |
| `## Heading 2` | Medium heading |
| `### Heading 3` | Small heading |
| `**Bold text**` | **Bold text** |
| `*Italic text*` | *Italic text* |
| `- List item` | Bullet list |
| `1. Numbered item` | Numbered list |
| `[Link text](https://example.com)` | Hyperlink |
| `[[Note name]]` | Link to another note in your vault |
| `> Quote` | Block quote |
| `` `code` `` | Inline code |

---

## Step 8: Create Your First Note

Let's practice:

1. Click the **"Create new note"** icon (top left, looks like a page)
2. Type a title like "My First Note"
3. Start writing in markdown:

```markdown
# My First Note

## What I'm Learning

- Obsidian basics
- Markdown syntax
- How to organize my research

## Goals

1. Complete the Liaison Program
2. Master data analysis
3. Tell stories with data
```

4. Obsidian saves automatically—no need to click Save!
5. Notice the file appears in your vault in the **File Explorer** (left sidebar)

---

## Step 9: Connect Your Notes (Backlinks)

One powerful feature of Obsidian is **linking notes together**. This creates a "knowledge graph" of your research.

### 9.1 Create a Link

In any note, type `[[` and start typing a note name:

```markdown
# My Research

I'm reading [[Weekly Journal Template]] to understand the reflection process.

I also reference [[02_Literature]] for my sources.
```

Obsidian will suggest existing notes. Select one or type a new name to create a new linked note.

### 9.2 View Backlinks

On the right side of any note, you'll see a **Backlinks** panel. This shows all notes that link to the current note—a powerful way to see connections in your research!

---

## Step 10: Tips for Success

### Keep It Simple

Don't over-customize at first. Start with the default theme and no plugins. Add what you need as you go.

### Use the Vault Structure

The Liaison_Vault comes pre-organized:
- **00_Inbox**: Capture ideas quickly here
- **01_Journal**: Weekly reflections
- **02_Literature**: Research notes and citations
- **03_Project**: Your active research work
- **04_Resources**: Attach images, PDFs, videos

Follow this structure to stay organized.

### Back Up Your Work

If using Git:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update research notes"
git push
```

Or regularly copy your `Liaison_Vault` folder to an external drive.

### Embrace Plain Text

One beauty of Obsidian is that everything is plain markdown. You can:
- Open notes in any text editor
- Version control with Git
- Search with command-line tools
- Never worry about proprietary formats

## Troubleshooting

### QMD Files Won't Open

Make sure you've installed and enabled the **qmd as md** plugin (see Step 4.2).

### Plugin Not Showing

Try restarting Obsidian. Sometimes plugins need to reload.

### Can't Find My Vault

Make sure you opened the correct folder as a vault. Look for a `.obsidian` folder inside your vault folder—that's how Obsidian knows it's a vault.

### Performance Slow

If Obsidian feels sluggish:
- Disable unused plugins
- Check your note count (very large vaults may slow down)
- Restart Obsidian
