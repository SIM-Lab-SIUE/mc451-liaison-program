```
Research Question: Do news headlines use emotional language?
  ↓
Construct: Emotional Language
  ↓
Variables: 
  - Emotion Type (happy, sad, angry, fearful, neutral)
  - Intensity (1=none, 2=weak, 3=moderate, 4=strong)
  ↓
Operational Definition:
  "Look for words in Positive Valence List or Negative Valence List. 
  Code intensity by counting emotional adjectives and adverbs."
  ↓
Edge Cases:
  - Sarcasm: Code literally (irony is not coded)
  - Quotes: Code the quoted words, not the attribution
  - Emojis: Convert to emotion, code with text rules
```

**Activities Needed:**
1. **Variable Definition Workshop** - Guided practice defining 3-4 variables
2. **Data Dictionary Creation** - Using the template, build their own

## 🎓 Notes on Course Design

### The Five-Phase Model

Students progress through:
1. **Orientation** - Understand the role and tools
2. **Discovery** - Ask good questions, plan research
3. **Dictionary** - Define measurements precisely
4. **Execution** - Collect and analyze data
5. **Delivery** - Communicate findings to stakeholders

Each phase builds on the previous. Students produce tangible artifacts:
- Phase 1: Configured vault
- Phase 2: Research proposal
- Phase 3: Data dictionary/codebook
- Phase 4: Analysis and visualizations
- Phase 5: Presentation/report

### Learning Pathways

Throughout, students engage in three thinking modes:
- **The Connector** - Link theory to practice
- **The Troubleshooter** - Solve real problems
- **The Critic** - Evaluate claims and methods

These appear in journal reflections and activity reflections.

### Assessment Philosophy

Rather than heavy exams, assessment comes through:
- Completed artifacts (proposals, dictionaries, analyses)
- Reflection on process
- Peer review (learning from others)
- Real-world application (applying to actual data/projects)

---

## 🔗 Content Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Orientation)
  ↓
Phase 2 (Discovery) ← Student must have research question & data plan
  ↓
Phase 3 (Dictionary) ← Depends on variables from Phase 2
  ↓
Phase 4 (Execution) ← Uses dictionary from Phase 3, plan from Phase 2
  ↓
Phase 5 (Delivery) ← Communicates analysis from Phase 4
```

Each phase depends on successful completion of previous phases. Make this clear to students.

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Can phases be customized per student or instructor?**  
A: Absolutely. The framework is flexible. Instructors can:
- Swap examples to their field
- Adjust time estimates per cohort
- Add/remove activities
- Use different tools in Phase 4

**Q: How long should each activity take?**  
A: Time commitment in header is guideline. Actual time varies:
- Experienced researchers: 40% less time
- First-time researchers: 50% more time
- Provide minimum and maximum estimates

**Q: Should there be grading rubrics?**  
A: Yes. Add rubric to bottom of each phase:
- Excellent (90-100%)
- Good (80-89%)
- Satisfactory (70-79%)
- Needs Work (<70%)

**Q: Can students work on multiple phases simultaneously?**  
A: Technically yes, but discourage it. Sequential engagement ensures foundational understanding.
