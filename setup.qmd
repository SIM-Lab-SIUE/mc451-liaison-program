## Welcome to the Liaison Program

This page will guide you through your initial setup. Complete these steps before Phase 1.

---

## Step 1: Download Your Workspace (5 minutes)

Visit the **[Resources page](resources/)** and download the `Liaison_Vault.zip` file.

Extract it to a location like:
- **Mac/Linux**: `~/Documents/Liaison_Vault`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Liaison_Vault`

---

## Step 2: Install Obsidian (5 minutes)

1. Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and download Obsidian
2. Install it on your computer
3. Open Obsidian and select **"Open folder as vault"**
4. Navigate to your `Liaison_Vault` folder and open it

**First time in Obsidian?**
- Click the folder icon on the left sidebar to see your vault structure
- Open `00_START_HERE.md` to read your orientation guide

---

## Step 3: Configure Obsidian Settings (3 minutes)

Once your vault is open in Obsidian:

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon, bottom left)
2. Click **Files & Links** in the sidebar
3. Under "Default location for new attachments", select **04_Resources**
4. This ensures all images, PDFs, and media files go to the right place

---

## Step 4: Explore Your Vault Structure

Your vault contains:

| Folder | Purpose | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **00_Inbox** | Quick notes & ideas | Capture thoughts here first |
| **01_Journal** | Weekly reflections | Use the template to reflect each week |
| **02_Literature** | Reading notes | Store all your research notes here |
| **03_Project** | Active research work | Organize by prospectus, codebook, data, drafts |
| **04_Resources** | Media & attachments | Images, PDFs, external files |
| **99_Templates** | Reusable templates | Copy these to start assignments |

---

## Step 5: Review the Weekly Journal Template (5 minutes)

Open **99_Templates** → **Weekly_Journal_Template.md**

This template guides you to reflect using one of three thinking paths:
- **The Connector**: How does this apply to my project?
- **The Troubleshooter**: What broke and how did I fix it?
- **The Critic**: Does this hold true in my experience?

---

## Step 6: You're Ready!

Once you complete these steps, move to **Phase 1: Orientation** in the sidebar to begin.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I extracted the ZIP file but Obsidian won't open it as a vault**
- Make sure you're opening the folder that contains the `.obsidian` hidden folder
- Try right-clicking the folder and checking "Show hidden files" if needed

**Q: Where do I put my weekly journal entries?**
- Create a new file in `01_Journal` named something like `Week_01_MyName.md`
- Copy the template from `99_Templates/Weekly_Journal_Template.md` and fill it out

**Q: Can I share my vault with classmates?**
- Yes! You can email them the ZIP file, or sync it via Git/GitHub for collaborative projects
