## 💡 Philosophy Behind This Handoff

### Knowledge is Power
- Everything is documented (not just in people's heads)
- Anyone can pick up the work (not dependent on one person)
- New team members get up to speed quickly
- Team grows stronger as documentation improves

### Assumptions Are Evil
- Every why is explained (not just how)
- Design decisions are documented (not questioned later)
- Alternative approaches are noted (future options clear)
- Trade-offs are recorded (context preserved)

### Clarity is Kindness
- Simple language (not jargon overload)
- Examples everywhere (not abstract concepts only)
- Step-by-step instructions (not vague directions)
- Multiple angles (different learning styles)

### Good Code is Obvious Code
- Code comments explain intent
- Function names are clear
- Examples are provided
- Documentation is linked from code
