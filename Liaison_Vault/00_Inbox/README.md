# \ud83d\udce5 Inbox - Quick Capture Zone

This is your **dumping ground** for rough thoughts, quick observations, and ideas that need processing later.

## What Belongs Here

- \u2705 Class discussion notes
- \u2705 Random observations about your project
- \u2705 Links and resources to read later
- \u2705 \"Shower thoughts\" about research
- \u2705 Quick reflections before they're polished
- \u2705 Daily notes (if you enable that feature)

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- \u274c Polished journal entries (those go in `01_Journal`)
- \u274c Literature notes (those go in `02_Literature`)
- \u274c Project files (those go in `03_Project`)

## The Inbox Philosophy

**Keep it messy.** This is for speed, not perfection.

Think of this like:
- The notepad on your desk
- Voice memos on your phone
- Sticky notes on your monitor

**Process regularly:** Once a week, review your Inbox and move important items to the right folders.

## Tips for Using the Inbox

### Daily Notes (Recommended)
1. Enable Daily Notes in Obsidian Settings
2. Set location to `00_Inbox/`
3. Press `Ctrl+T` (or `Cmd+T`) to create today's note
4. Brain dump throughout the day

### Quick Capture Template
```markdown
# [Date] - Quick Note

**Context:** [Where did this idea come from?]

**The Idea:**

[Write here]

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Move to appropriate folder
- [ ] Follow up on [X]
```

### Processing Your Inbox (Weekly Ritual)

Every Sunday (or start of your week):
1. Review all notes in the Inbox
2. Ask: "Does this need action?"
   - Yes → Move to project folder or create task
   - No → Delete or archive
3. Move processed items to appropriate folders
4. Start fresh next week

**Remember:** The Inbox is your friend. Dump first, organize later. \ud83d\ude80
