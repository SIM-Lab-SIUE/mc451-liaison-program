## The Three Thinking Paths

### \ud83d\udd17 Path 1: The Connector
**When to use:** You see a clear link between theory and practice.

**Example topics:**
- \"How framing theory explains my TikTok project\"
- \"Applying thematic analysis to interview transcripts\"
- \"Using ggplot2 concepts to visualize my data\"

**Goal:** Show you can translate theory into action.

---

### \ud83d\udd27 Path 2: The Troubleshooter
**When to use:** You hit a technical roadblock and solved it.

**Example topics:**
- \"Why my R script kept crashing (and how I fixed it)\"
- \"Debugging Quarto rendering errors\"
- \"Solving CSV import issues in RStudio\"

**Goal:** Document solutions for future-you (and help classmates).

---

### \ud83c\udfaf Path 3: The Critic
**When to use:** You disagree with or want to interrogate a reading.

**Example topics:**
- \"Does agenda-setting theory still work in the algorithm era?\"
- \"The author claims objectivity is dead\u2014but is it?\"
- \"Critiquing the survey methodology in Chapter 5\"

**Goal:** Develop your analytical voice and critical thinking.

## Tips for Success

### Make It Personal
Don't write \"the student\" or \"one might think.\"\n\nWrite \"I noticed...\" \"This made me think...\" \"I struggled with...\"\n\nYour voice matters.

### Link to Other Notes
Use Obsidian's linking feature: `[[Note Title]]`

Example:
> \"This connects to [[Week 2 Journal]] and my [[Project Prospectus]].\"\n\n### Use Tags Strategically
Add tags at the bottom:\n```markdown\n#journal #week5 #phaseII #theArchitect #framing\n```

Search later with tags to find patterns in your thinking.

## Grading Rubric (Reference)

Your journals are graded on:
- **Depth** (not just summary, but analysis)
- **Connection** (links theory to practice/project)
- **Clarity** (well-organized, proofread)
- **Timeliness** (submitted by Monday deadline)

---

**Pro tip:** Write your journal RIGHT AFTER class while ideas are fresh. Don't wait until Sunday night! \ud83d\ude80
