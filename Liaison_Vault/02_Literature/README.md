Write in Your Own Words\nDon't just copy-paste. Translate concepts into language you understand.\n\n### 2. Cite Page Numbers\nYou'll thank yourself later when writing your final report.\n\n### 3. Connect to Your Project\nEvery note should answer: \"How does this relate to my research?\"\n\n### 4. Use the \"So What?\" Test\nIf you can't explain why a concept matters, dig deeper.\n\n---\n\n## Zotero Integration (Recommended)\n\n### Setup\n1. Install [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (free)\n2. Install the Zotero Connector browser extension\n3. Install the Obsidian Zotero plugin\n4. Configure plugin to export notes to `02_Literature/`\n\n### Workflow\n1. Save sources to Zotero as you read\n2. Take notes in Zotero\n3. Export to Obsidian with one click\n4. All your citations live in both systems\n\n---\n\n## Using Literature Notes for Your Literature Review (Week 5)\n\nWhen it's time to write your lit review:\n\n1. **Tag your notes** with relevant themes\n2. **Search by tag** to see all related notes\n3. **Use the graph view** to see connections\n4. **Copy relevant sections** into your Quarto document\n5. **Cite properly** using your stored references\n\n---\n\n## Example: A Good Literature Note\n\n```markdown\n# Entman (1993) - Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm\n\n**Full Citation:**\nEntman, R. M. (1993). Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm. \n*Journal of Communication*, 43(4), 51\u201358.\n\n**Relevance:** Core theory for my news analysis project.\n\n---\n\n## Key Argument\n\nFraming involves **selection** and **salience**\u2014choosing which aspects of reality \nto emphasize in a communication. Frames define problems, diagnose causes, make \nmoral judgments, and suggest remedies.\n\n---\n\n## The Four Framing Functions\n\n1. **Define problems** - What's the issue?\n2. **Diagnose causes** - Who/what is responsible?\n3. **Make moral judgments** - Is this good or bad?\n4. **Suggest remedies** - What should be done?\n\n---\n\n## Key Quote\n\n> \"To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them \n> more salient in a communicating text\" (p. 52)\n\nThis is THE definition I'll use in my codebook.\n\n---\n\n## My Thoughts\n\nThis helps me operationalize \"frame\" in my content analysis. I need to \nlook for:\n- What problem the article focuses on\n- Who it blames\n- What solution it implies\n\nConnects to [[Week 8 Codebook]] and [[Project Prospectus]].\n\n---\n\n**Tags:** #literature #framing #contentAnalysis #week5\n```\n\n---\n\n**Pro tip:** Take literature notes AS YOU READ, not after. Your brain will thank you. \ud83d\udcda
