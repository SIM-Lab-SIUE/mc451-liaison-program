# Week 03: Project Setup

**Role:** The Scientist \| **Phase:** Organization \| **Points:** 25

**Due:** Before Week 4 class meeting
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 The Mission (Why we are doing this)

Amateur researchers have files scattered across Downloads, Desktop, and Documents folders. **Professional Liaisons** maintain a "Chain of Custody."

If a colleague sits down at your computer, they should be able to navigate your entire project without asking you a single question. This week, you will prove that your "Digital Office" is built to code and ready for data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠️ The Task (Step-by-Step Instructions)

### Step 1: Verify Your Vault Architecture

You downloaded your `Liaison_Vault.zip` in Phase 1. Verify that your vault contains these folders **exactly** as written (case-sensitive):

```         
Liaison_Vault/
├── 00_Inbox           (Messy notes)
├── 01_Journal         (Reflections)
├── 02_Literature      (PDFs & readings)
├── 03_Project/        (Active research work)
│   ├── 01_Prospectus/
│   ├── 02_Codebook/
│   ├── 03_Data/
│   └── 04_Drafts/
├── 04_Resources/      (Media & attachments)
├── 99_Templates/      (Reusable templates)
└── 00_START_HERE.md   (Orientation guide)
```

**What to check:** - All folder names start with `00`, `01`, `02`, etc. - No spaces in folder names (e.g., `01_Journal` NOT `01 Journal`) - Subfolders exist inside `03_Project/` - Hidden folder `.obsidian/` is present (if using Obsidian)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 2: Open Your Vault in Obsidian

Tell Obsidian this folder is a vault:

1.  **Open Obsidian**
2.  Click **"Open folder as vault"** (or **File → Open as vault**)
3.  Navigate to your `Liaison_Vault` folder and select it
4.  Obsidian will create a `.obsidian/` hidden folder automatically

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 3: Verify the File Explorer View

In Obsidian's left sidebar, you should see the **File Explorer** showing all your folders:

-   ✅ File tree shows numbered folders in correct order (00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 99)
-   ✅ Subfolders visible under `03_Project/`
-   ✅ `00_START_HERE.md` file visible at vault root
-   ✅ `.obsidian/` folder visible in file explorer (or accessible via View → Show Hidden Files)

**Take a Screenshot:** Capture the File Explorer pane showing your complete vault structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📤 Submission Requirements

Upload a **Screenshot (JPG or PNG)** showing your Obsidian file explorer with all folders visible.

**What the screenshot must show:** 1. Obsidian window with your vault name in the title 2. File explorer sidebar displaying the numbered folder structure 3. All main folders: 00_Inbox, 01_Journal, 02_Literature, 03_Project, 04_Resources, 99_Templates 4. Subfolders inside 03_Project visible (01_Prospectus, 02_Codebook, 03_Data, 04_Drafts)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧐 Grading Checklist (Pass/Fail)

Your submission will be checked for:

-   [ ] **Numbered Folders:** Do folders start with `00`, `01`, `02`, etc.?
-   [ ] **No Spaces:** Are filenames clean? (e.g., `01_Journal`, NOT `01 Journal`)
-   [ ] **Folder Structure:** Are all 6 main folders present?
-   [ ] **Subfolders:** Does `03_Project/` contain the four expected subfolders?
-   [ ] **Obsidian Open:** Is Obsidian clearly open with your vault?
-   [ ] **Screenshot Clear:** Can all folder names be read clearly?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Already have a vault from Phase 1?** You're done! Just take the screenshot.

**Lost your vault?** Re-download from the [Resources page](../../resources/index.qmd) and extract fresh.

**Obsidian not showing all folders?** Try: - Restart Obsidian - Go to **Settings → File & Links → Show hidden files** (toggle on) - Refresh the file explorer

**Stuck?** Reach out via email or office hours. We'll get it sorted!
