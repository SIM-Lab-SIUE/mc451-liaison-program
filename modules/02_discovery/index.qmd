# Phase 2: Discovery

**Duration:** Weeks 3-4 | **Time Commitment:** ~6 hours  
Learn research methodologies and frame your research questions
:::

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase 2, you will:

:::{.learning-objectives}
- ✅ Frame clear research questions and hypotheses
- ✅ Map stakeholders and identify data sources
- ✅ Plan ethical data collection approaches
- ✅ Evaluate existing research and prior work
- ✅ Identify potential risks and mitigations
- ✅ Present a mini research proposal
:::

---

## What You'll Do

In Phase 2, you'll move from understanding the liaison role to asking **good questions**:

**Frame Research Questions** — Move from vague ideas to clear, testable questions with defined variables

**Map Stakeholders & Sources** — Understand who needs what information and where data lives

**Plan Data Collection** — Design ethical approaches (surveys, interviews, data scraping, observations)

**Identify Risks** — Consider privacy, bias, sampling, and other potential challenges

---

## Phase 2 Content & Activities

### Activity 1: Understanding Good Research Questions (Week 3)

Work through these steps:

1. **Read & Compare** - Review 2-3 example research questions from your field
2. **Critique** - What makes them clear or vague? What variables are defined?
3. **Rewrite** - Take a vague question and rewrite it with clear variables

**Example:**
- ❌ *Vague:* "How do people use social media?"
- ✅ *Clear:* "What communication patterns distinguish active vs. passive users on TikTok among ages 18-25?"

**Submit:** Your rewritten research questions (2-3 examples) in `03_Project/01_Prospectus/`

### Activity 2: Stakeholder & Data Source Mapping (Week 4)

Create a one-page visual map showing:

- **Who cares?** - Primary stakeholders (who needs your findings?)
- **What's available?** - Existing data sources (surveys, databases, interviews, archives)
- **What's missing?** - Gaps in current data
- **How will you collect?** - Your planned methods

**Submit:** A visual map (diagram, table, or infographic) in `03_Project/01_Prospectus/`

### Activity 3: Mini Research Proposal (Week 5)

Write a 2-3 page mini proposal including:

1. **Problem Statement** - Why does this question matter?
2. **Research Questions** - What specifically will you investigate?
3. **Methods Overview** - How will you collect data?
4. **Timeline** - When will each step happen?
5. **Risks & Mitigations** - What could go wrong and how will you address it?

**Submit:** `03_Project/01_Prospectus/Mini_Proposal.md`

## Key Concepts: The Research Mindset

### Variables (The Building Blocks)

**Independent Variable** - What you *control* or *predict from*  
**Dependent Variable** - What you *measure* or *predict to*  
**Control Variables** - What you *hold constant*

### Research Designs

- **Exploratory** - What's happening? (descriptive)
- **Explanatory** - Why is it happening? (causal)
- **Evaluative** - Is it working? (assessment)

### Ethical Considerations

- **Informed Consent** - Did people agree to participate?
- **Privacy & Confidentiality** - How will you protect personal data?
- **Fairness & Bias** - Are your methods equitable?
- **Harm Reduction** - Could participation cause distress?

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of Phase 2, you should have:

:::{.deliverables}
✅ **2-3 Clear Research Questions** - With defined independent/dependent variables  
✅ **Stakeholder & Data Source Map** - One-page visual showing who cares and what data exists  
✅ **Mini Research Proposal** - 2-3 pages outlining problem, methods, timeline, risks  
✅ **Week 3-5 Journal Entries** - Reflections on your research process  
✅ **Ready for Phase 3** - Understanding your data landscape  
:::

## Milestone Timeline

| Week | Deliverable | Status |
|------|---|---|
| Week 3 | Research questions draft | Submit in prospectus folder |
| Week 4 | Stakeholder/data map | One-page visual |
| Week 5 | Mini proposal | 2-3 pages + class discussion |
