## What You Will Do
- Collect, clean, and analyze data using your approved plan
- Track versions of datasets and scripts
- Generate figures/tables that answer your research questions

## Deliverables
- Clean dataset (documented) + analysis notes
- 2–3 core visualizations/tables with captions
- Brief memo linking results to questions and caveats

## Milestones
- **Week 9:** Data collection complete
- **Week 10:** Cleaning script + documented decisions
- **Week 11:** First-pass results shared for feedback

## Activities
- Use `03_Project/03_Data/` for raw vs. clean data; keep a `README` of steps
- Save analysis scripts in `03_Project/04_Drafts/` (R, Python, or Excel log)
- Note any surprises or limitations in your journal

## Templates & Links
- Journal reflections: `99_Templates/Weekly_Journal_Template.md`
