# Phase 4: Execution

**Duration:** Weeks 8-10 | **Time Commitment:** ~10 hours  
Collect, clean, and analyze your data
:::

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase 4, you will:

:::{.learning-objectives}
- ✅ Collect data according to your research plan
- ✅ Clean and verify data quality
- ✅ Document all data transformation steps
- ✅ Perform preliminary analysis
- ✅ Generate visualizations and summary tables
- ✅ Communicate findings and limitations
:::

---

## What You'll Do

Phase 4 is where you **execute your plan**:

**Collect** - Gather data using your approved methods (surveys, interviews, scraping, etc.)  
**Clean** - Verify quality, handle missing values, fix formatting  
**Analyze** - Apply statistical or qualitative methods to answer your questions  
**Visualize** - Create tables, charts, and figures that show your findings  
**Document** - Track every decision you make so others (and you, later!) understand what you did

---

## Phase 4 Content & Activities

### Activity 1: Data Collection (Week 8)

Follow your approved data collection plan:

1. **Collect data** - Surveys, interviews, archival data, API scraping, etc.
2. **Track what's happening** - Keep notes in `00_Inbox/` of collection date, sample size, issues
3. **Store raw data** - Save exactly as received in `03_Project/03_Data/raw/`
4. **Document sources** - Who, when, where did this data come from?

**Organize your data folder:**
```
03_Project/03_Data/
├── raw/              # Exactly as received (don't modify!)
├── clean/            # After cleaning + transformation
├── README.md         # Overview of datasets + versions
└── data_log.txt      # Timeline of what was collected when
```

### Activity 2: Data Cleaning (Week 9)

Transform raw data into analysis-ready data:

1. **Check quality** - Are there missing values? Duplicates? Odd formatting?
2. **Fix issues** - Use R, Python, Excel, or whatever tool fits your data
3. **Document every step** - Save cleaning script showing exactly what you changed
4. **Create a log** - List decisions: "Removed 3 duplicate responses", "Standardized date format", etc.

**Create:** `03_Project/03_Data/cleaning_script.[R|py|xlsx]` + `cleaning_log.md`

**Cleaning Log Example:**
```markdown
## Data Cleaning Log

**Raw Data:** survey_responses_raw.csv (127 rows)

### Steps Taken:
1. Removed 2 duplicate response IDs (#45, #103)
2. Converted date_submitted from text to date format
3. Filled missing age_group values (n=5) using median imputation
4. Standardized text responses to lowercase
5. Removed 1 response with >50% missing values

**Result:** clean_data.csv (124 rows, 0 missing values)
**Date:** 2024-01-15 | **Tool:** R 4.3.2 | **Done by:** [Your Name]
```

### Activity 3: Preliminary Analysis (Week 9-10)

Apply your research methods:

1. **Descriptive stats** - How many? What's the range? What's typical?
2. **Inferential stats** (if applicable) - Test your hypotheses
3. **Qualitative coding** (if applicable) - Find themes and patterns
4. **Create visualizations** - 2-3 core figures/tables that directly answer your research questions

**Save:** Analysis scripts in `03_Project/04_Drafts/`

### Activity 4: Share First Results (Week 10)

Get feedback before finalizing:

1. **Create a short memo** - What you found, what it means, what's uncertain
2. **Include visuals** - Share 2-3 key tables/charts
3. **List limitations** - What could be affecting your results?
4. **Share with Dr. Leith** - Email or submit for feedback

**Template:**
```markdown
# Data Analysis Memo

## Overview
**Research Question:** [Your question]  
**Sample Size:** [N]  
**Analysis Date:** [Date]

## Key Findings
1. [Finding 1 with figure/table reference]
2. [Finding 2 with figure/table reference]
3. [Finding 3 with figure/table reference]

## Interpretation
[What do these findings mean? How do they answer your research question?]

## Limitations
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]
- [How might these affect your conclusions?]

## Next Steps
[What still needs clarification or additional analysis?]

✅ **Clean Data** - Documented cleaning process  
✅ **Cleaning Log** - Every step explained  
✅ **Analysis Scripts** - Reproducible code showing your work  
✅ **2-3 Key Visualizations** - Tables/figures directly answering your questions  
✅ **Data Memo** - Summary of findings, limitations, next steps  
✅ **Week 8-10 Journal Entries** - Reflections on your analysis journey  
✅ **Ready for Phase 5** - Findings ready to present  
:::

## Milestone Timeline

| Week | Activity | Deliverable |
|------|----------|---|
| Week 8 | Data collection | Raw data file + collection log |
| Week 9 | Data cleaning | Clean data + cleaning script/log |
| Week 10 | Analysis & memo | 2-3 visualizations + analysis memo |

---

## Common Data Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Missing values | Document why they're missing, decide: remove, impute, or keep |
| Duplicates | Identify (check IDs), document, remove if not intentional |
| Formatting inconsistencies | Standardize dates, text case, number format |
| Outliers | Document, investigate cause, decide whether to keep/remove |
| Encoding issues | Check file format (UTF-8), re-import if needed |
