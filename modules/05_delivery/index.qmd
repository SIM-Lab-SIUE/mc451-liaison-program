:::

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase 5, you will:

:::{.learning-objectives}
- ✅ Transform data findings into compelling narratives
- ✅ Create visualizations tailored for different audiences
- ✅ Write executive summaries and briefs
- ✅ Present findings with confidence and clarity
- ✅ Translate statistics into actionable insights
- ✅ Reflect on your research journey and next steps
:::

## What You'll Do

This is your moment to **tell the story** your data reveals:

**Narrative Development** - Translate numbers into meaning: "What did we learn?"  
**Visual Communication** - Design slides/infographics that guide your audience through the story  
**Executive Briefing** - One-page summary for decision makers  
**Presentation** - Present findings in a clear, engaging way  
**Reflection** - Capture lessons learned for next time

---

## Phase 5 Content & Activities

### Activity 1: Craft Your Story (Week 11)

Before making slides, nail your narrative:

1. **Identify your key insights** - Which 2-3 findings matter most?
2. **Create an outline** - How do you guide your audience through the data?
3. **Add "So what?"** - For each finding, explain why it matters

**Outline Template:**
```markdown
# Research Story Outline

## Hook (30 seconds)
[What question were we answering? Why does it matter?]

## Context (1-2 minutes)
[Brief background: who cares, what was the challenge?]

## The Findings (3-4 minutes)
### Finding 1: [Headline]
- Data point 1
- Data point 2
- **So what?** [Why does this matter? What should we do?]

### Finding 2: [Headline]
- Data point 1
- Data point 2
- **So what?** [Implications]

### Finding 3: [Headline]
- Data point 1
- Data point 2
- **So what?** [Action items]

## Limitations (1 minute)
[What are we uncertain about?]

## Next Steps (1-2 minutes)
[What should happen next?]
```

**Create:** `03_Project/04_Drafts/Story_Outline.md`

### Activity 2: Create a Slide Deck or Brief (Week 12)

**Option A: Slide Deck** (for live presentation)
- Title slide with question
- 1 context slide
- 2-3 finding slides with visualizations
- 1 limitations slide
- 1 next steps/call-to-action slide
- **Total: 7-8 slides** (aim for 1-2 minutes per slide)

**Option B: One-Page Brief** (for email/sharing)
- Header with research question
- 3-4 key findings with visual
- Brief interpretation
- Limitations (small print)
- Contact + next steps

**Design Tips:**
- ✅ One major idea per slide
- ✅ Large, readable fonts (18pt minimum)
- ✅ Colors that support understanding (not decoration)
- ✅ Real data visuals (your actual charts/tables)
- ✅ Simple, clean layouts
- ❌ Avoid: dense text, clip art, too many colors

**Tools:**
- Google Slides (free, easy sharing)
- PowerPoint (familiar, flexible)
- Keynote (Apple, polished)
- Canva (beautiful templates)
- Quarto (reproducible, code-based)

**Create:** `03_Project/04_Drafts/Presentation_Deck.pdf` or `Brief.pdf`

### Activity 3: Translate for Your Audience (Week 12)

**Different audiences, different messages:**

**For Executives:**
- Bottom line: What's the recommendation?
- Impact: What does this mean for our goals?
- Minimize jargon; focus on action

**For Data Scientists:**
- Methodology: How did you approach this?
- Limitations: What aren't we capturing?
- Code & details available if needed

**For General Audience:**
- Story: What happened and why does it matter?
- Visuals: Show don't tell
- Plain language: Avoid stats jargon

**Create:** Brief version (1-2 sentences) of each finding for different audiences in your outline.

### Activity 4: Presentation & Reflection (Week 13)

**Presentation Options:**
- In-class presentation (5-10 minutes)
- Recorded video (3-5 minutes)
- Written report with visuals
- Poster presentation (if poster session)

**Before presenting:**
1. **Rehearse with a peer** - Get feedback
2. **Time yourself** - Stay within limits
3. **Check visuals** - Do all graphs display correctly?
4. **Practice Q&A** - What might people ask?

**After presenting:**
1. **Capture feedback** - What questions did people ask?
2. **Note surprises** - What did people react to most?
3. **Reflect in journal** - What would you do differently next time?

## Communication Templates

### Plain Language Translation Guide

| Technical | Plain Language |
|---|---|
| "Statistically significant difference (p < 0.05)" | "This difference is very unlikely to have happened by chance" |
| "Negative correlation (r = -0.72)" | "As X increases, Y tends to decrease" |
| "Thematic coding revealed 5 emergent categories" | "When we looked for patterns, we found 5 main themes" |
| "Inter-rater reliability was 0.84" | "Two coders agreed 84% of the time" |

### "So What?" Template for Each Finding

```
DATA: [State what you found]
MEANING: [What does it mean?]
ACTION: [What should we do about it?]

EXAMPLE:
DATA: 78% of respondents prefer format A over format B
MEANING: Most users find format A easier/better
ACTION: Recommend switching to format A; monitor user satisfaction
```
