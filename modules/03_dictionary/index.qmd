title: "Phase 3: The Dictionary"
---

## What You Will Do
- Define variables, constructs, and coding rules
- Build a data dictionary/codebook for your project
- Pilot-test definitions with a small sample

## Deliverables
- Data dictionary v1 with variable names, types, allowed values, and examples
- Coding decision log (edge cases, clarifications)
- Pilot results summary + changes you made

## Milestones
- **Week 6:** Draft variable list
- **Week 7:** Pilot coding on 10–20 items
- **Week 8:** Submit revised data dictionary

## Activities
- Copy the Data Dictionary Template from `99_Templates/Data_Dictionary_Template.md`
- Run a short inter-coder reliability check (pair with a peer if possible)
- Record ambiguities and resolve them in the decision log

## Templates & Links
- Data Dictionary Template: `99_Templates/Data_Dictionary_Template.md`
- Journal reflections: `99_Templates/Weekly_Journal_Template.md`
- Store drafts in `03_Project/02_Codebook/`

## Next Steps
- → Move to **Phase 4: Execution** once your dictionary is stable
