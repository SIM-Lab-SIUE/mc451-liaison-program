# Phase 3: The Dictionary

**Duration:** Weeks 5-7 | **Time Commitment:** ~8 hours  
Create a data dictionary and codebook for your project
:::

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase 3, you will:

:::{.learning-objectives}
- ✅ Define variables, constructs, and measurement rules
- ✅ Build a comprehensive data dictionary/codebook
- ✅ Test definitions with pilot data
- ✅ Document coding decisions and edge cases
- ✅ Assess inter-coder reliability
- ✅ Iterate on definitions based on pilot testing
:::

## What You'll Do

A **data dictionary** is like a translation guide for your data. It tells anyone (including future you!) exactly what each variable means:

- **Variable names** - How is this stored in your data?
- **Definitions** - What does this variable measure?
- **Types** - Is it text, number, date, category?
- **Allowed values** - What answers are valid?
- **Examples** - Real samples of how to code things
- **Special rules** - Edge cases and how to handle them

---

## Phase 3 Content & Activities

### Activity 1: Start Your Data Dictionary (Week 5)

1. **Copy the Template** - Get the Data Dictionary Template from your vault
2. **List Your Variables** - From your research questions, what will you measure?
3. **Define Each One** - Write clear definitions for every variable
4. **Specify Types** - Is each variable numeric, text, categorical, etc.?

**Example:**

| Variable | Definition | Type | Values | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `age_group` | Age category of respondent | Categorical | 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 45+ | "26-35" |
| `engagement_score` | 1-10 scale of user interaction frequency | Numeric | 1-10 (whole numbers) | 7 |
| `content_type` | Primary content category shared | Text | Any string ≤100 chars | "news_article" |

**Submit:** First draft in `03_Project/02_Codebook/Data_Dictionary_v1.md`

### Activity 2: Pilot Code Your Data (Week 6)

Test your definitions on a small sample:

1. **Select 10-20 items** - Sample from your actual data
2. **Code them** - Use your definitions to code each item
3. **Track problems** - What was ambiguous or unclear?
4. **Document decisions** - How did you resolve edge cases?

**Create:** `03_Project/02_Codebook/Pilot_Decisions_Log.md`

**Example entry:**
```
VARIABLE: content_type
PROBLEM: Item #5 is a news article shared as a screenshot
DECISION: Code as "news_article" (focus on content, not format)
APPLIED: Items #5, #12, #18
```

### Activity 3: Get Feedback (Week 7)

**Optional: Inter-Coder Reliability Check**

If possible, have a peer code the same 10-20 items independently:

- Compare your coding - How often did you agree?
- Discuss disagreements - Why did you code differently?
- Update your definitions - Make them clearer if needed

**Measure:** Calculate % agreement or Cohen's Kappa (your instructor will guide this)

### Activity 4: Finalize & Iterate (Week 7)

Based on your pilot testing:

1. **Clarify definitions** - Rewrite anything that was confusing
2. **Add more examples** - Include edge cases you found
3. **Update allowed values** - Add any new categories you discovered
4. **Document assumptions** - What did you decide to do and why?

**Submit:** `03_Project/02_Codebook/Data_Dictionary_v2_Final.md` + Pilot Summary

---

## Key Concepts

### Variable Types

**Numeric** - Numbers you can do math with (age, score, count)  
**Categorical** - Limited set of categories (gender, region, type)  
**Text/String** - Free-form text (name, comment, description)  
**Date** - Time-based (2024-01-15)  
**Boolean** - True/False or Yes/No  

### Measurement Scales

**Nominal** - Categories with no order (blue, red, green)  
**Ordinal** - Ranked categories (low, medium, high)  
**Interval** - Numbers with equal spacing (temperature in°C)  
**Ratio** - Numbers with true zero (height, weight, age)

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of Phase 3, you should have:

:::{.deliverables}
✅ **Complete Data Dictionary** - All variables defined with types, values, examples  
✅ **Pilot Testing Results** - Coded 10-20 sample items  
✅ **Decisions Log** - Edge cases documented and resolved  
✅ **Updated Dictionary v2** - Refined based on pilot feedback  
✅ **Week 5-7 Journal Entries** - Reflections on your coding process  
✅ **Ready for Phase 4** - Your definitions are clear and tested

## Milestone Timeline

| Week | Activity | Deliverable |
|------|----------|---|
| Week 5 | Start data dictionary | Draft with variable list |
| Week 6 | Pilot code 10-20 items | Decisions log + coded samples |
| Week 7 | Refine & finalize | Data Dictionary v2 + summary |

---

## Example: Simple Data Dictionary

**Project:** Analyzing tweet sentiment about climate change

| Variable | Definition | Type | Values | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tweet_id` | Unique identifier | Text | Any string | "1234567890" |
| `date_posted` | When tweet was published | Date | YYYY-MM-DD | "2024-01-15" |
| `text` | Full text of tweet | Text | Free-form ≤280 chars | "Climate action is..." |
| `sentiment` | Overall emotional tone | Categorical | positive, neutral, negative | "positive" |
| `has_action_call` | Does tweet ask readers to do something? | Boolean | yes, no | "yes" |
| `reach` | Number of impressions | Numeric | 0-9,999,999 | 1250 |

## Next Phase

Once you complete Phase 3:

→ **[Phase 4: Execution](../04_execution/index.qmd)** - Apply your definitions and code all your data

---

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't know all variables yet?**  
A: Start with what you know. You can add more in Phase 4.

**Q: How detailed should my definitions be?**  
A: Detailed enough that someone else could code the same way.

**Q: What's a "good" inter-coder agreement score?**  
A: 80%+ agreement is typical; 90%+ is excellent.
