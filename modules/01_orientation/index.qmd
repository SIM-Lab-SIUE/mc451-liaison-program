## Welcome to Phase 1: Orientation

In this phase, you'll:

## What is a Communication Liaison?

*Edit this section with your course context and examples.*

A Communication Liaison bridges the gap between:
- **Data scientists** who understand the numbers
- **Creative teams** who understand the audience
- **Project stakeholders** who understand the goals

Your job is to translate, facilitate, and document.

## Reflection Prompt

Before moving to Phase 2, write a journal entry in `01_Journal/` answering:

*"What does it mean to be a Communication Liaison in my field? Who do I need to bridge gaps between?"*

Use one of the three thinking paths:
1. **The Connector** - How does this relate to what I already know?
2. **The Troubleshooter** - What challenges might I face?
3. **The Critic** - Does this resonate with my experience?
