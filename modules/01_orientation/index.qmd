## Your Role as a Communication Liaison

A Communication Liaison bridges the gap between:

- **Data Scientists** who understand the numbers
- **Creative Teams** who understand the audience
- **Project Stakeholders** who understand the goals

Your job is to **translate**, **facilitate**, and **document**—turning complex insights into clear action.

### The Liaison Mindset
- **Translate**: Turn jargon into clarity
- **Facilitate**: Help people understand each other
- **Document**: Create records for future reference
- **Guide**: Lead projects toward success

---

## Phase 1 Content & Activities

### Activity 1: Complete Your Setup (5-10 minutes)

Follow the [Setup Guide](../../setup.qmd) to:
1. Download your `Liaison_Vault.zip` from the [Resources page](../../resources/index.qmd)
2. Extract it to your Documents folder
3. Install and configure Obsidian
4. Connect your vault to Obsidian
5. Configure attachment settings

**Due:** Before your first class meeting

### Activity 2: Explore Your Vault Structure (15 minutes)

Open your Liaison_Vault and review each folder:

| Folder | Purpose | What You'll Do |
|--------|---------|---|
| **00_Inbox** | Quick capture | Write daily thoughts & ideas here first |
| **01_Journal** | Weekly reflections | Use templates to reflect each week |
| **02_Literature** | Research notes | Organize all your reading notes |
| **03_Project** | Active research | Organize by prospectus, codebook, data, drafts |
| **04_Resources** | Media & attachments | Store images, PDFs, external files |
| **99_Templates** | Reusable templates | Copy templates to start new work |

### Activity 3: Your First Journal Entry (10-15 minutes)

Create a new file in `01_Journal/` named `Week_01_Reflection.md`

Use one of the three thinking paths:

1. **The Connector** - How does being a liaison relate to things you already know?
2. **The Troubleshooter** - What challenges might you face in this role?
3. **The Critic** - Does the liaison role resonate with your experience?

Write 3-5 sentences. No pressure—just think on paper. 📝
