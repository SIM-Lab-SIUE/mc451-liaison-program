# R & RStudio Setup Guide

R and RStudio are essential tools for statistical analysis and data science in this course. This guide covers installation on all major operating systems.

## What You're Installing

- **R**: The core statistical programming language and environment
- **RStudio**: An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that makes R much easier to use

## Installation by Operating System

### Windows

#### Step 1: Install R

1. Go to [CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
2. Click **"Download R for Windows"**
3. Click **"base"** (first option)
4. Click the download link for the latest version (typically named something like `R-4.x.x-win.exe`)
5. Run the installer
   - Accept default settings (you can leave everything as-is)
   - Click through the installation wizard
   - Installation typically takes 2-5 minutes

#### Step 2: Install RStudio

1. Go to [Posit RStudio Downloads](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
2. Click **"Download RStudio Desktop"** for Windows
3. Run the installer
   - Accept default settings
   - The installer will detect your R installation automatically
   - Complete the installation

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

1. Open **RStudio** (search for it in Windows Start menu)
2. In the **Console** pane (usually bottom-left), you should see something like:
   ```
   R version 4.x.x (20XX-XX-XX) -- "..."
   ```
3. Type: `print("Hello, R!")` and press Enter
4. If you see `[1] "Hello, R!"`, you're ready to go!

### macOS

#### Step 1: Install R

**Option A: Using the installer (Recommended for beginners)**

1. Go to [CRAN macOS](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
2. Click **"Download R for macOS"**
3. Select the appropriate version:
   - **For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 chips)**: Download `R-x.x.x-arm64.pkg`
   - **For Intel Macs**: Download `R-x.x.x-x86_64.pkg`
   - (Unsure? Check Apple menu → About This Mac → Chip)
4. Run the `.pkg` installer and follow the prompts
5. Installation takes 2-5 minutes

**Option B: Using Homebrew (if you use Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install r
```

#### Step 2: Install RStudio

1. Go to [Posit RStudio Downloads](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
2. Click **"Download RStudio Desktop"** for macOS
3. Select the appropriate version for your Mac (Apple Silicon or Intel)
4. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
5. Drag RStudio to the Applications folder
6. Launch RStudio from Applications

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

1. Open **RStudio** (find in Applications folder or Spotlight search)
2. In the Console, type: `print("Hello, R!")` and press Enter
3. Confirm you see: `[1] "Hello, R!"`

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

#### Step 1: Install R

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install R
sudo apt install -y r-base r-base-dev
```

#### Step 2: Install RStudio

1. Go to [Posit RStudio Downloads](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
2. Select **"RStudio Desktop"** → Choose Linux version (Ubuntu 20/22 or Debian)
3. Download the `.deb` file
4. Install it:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i rstudio-[version].deb
   ```

Or install from terminal directly:
```bash
sudo apt install -y rstudio
```

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

1. Launch RStudio from applications menu or terminal:
   ```bash
   rstudio &
   ```
2. Test in Console: `print("Hello, R!")`
3. Confirm output: `[1] "Hello, R!"`

## Essential Next Steps

Once R and RStudio are installed, you need to set up your R environment for the course:

### 1. Set Your Working Directory

In RStudio Console, run:
```r
setwd("~/Documents")  # Or your preferred workspace folder
```

### 2. Install Course Packages

We'll use these packages throughout the course. Install them with:

```r
# Core data science packages
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse",      # Data wrangling and visualization
  "rmarkdown",      # Create documents with R code
  "quarto",         # Publishing system
  "shiny",          # Interactive web apps
  "ggplot2"         # Advanced visualization
))
```

This may take 5-15 minutes (packages are downloading and installing).

### 3. Verify Packages Loaded

Test that the main packages work:
```r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
print("All packages loaded successfully!")
```

If no errors appear, you're all set!

## Troubleshooting

### R won't start
- **Windows**: Try reinstalling R with administrator privileges
- **Mac**: Restart your computer and try again
- **Linux**: Run `sudo apt install -y r-base` to ensure all dependencies are installed

### RStudio can't find R
- RStudio should auto-detect R, but if not:
  - **Tools** → **Global Options** → **General**
  - Look for "R version" section
  - If blank, manually browse to your R installation

### Package installation fails
- Make sure you have internet connection
- Try: `install.packages("package_name", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")`
- Some packages require additional system libraries (ask in course chat!)

### Permission errors (especially macOS)
- Try: `install.packages("package", type="source")`
