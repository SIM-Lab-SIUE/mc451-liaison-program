## Background

I'm an Associate Professor of Mass Communications at SIUE, where I direct the Social Interaction & Media Lab (SIM Lab). My research focuses on how people communicate, connect, and collaborate through digital platforms—from video games and streaming to virtual reality and remote work environments.

Before joining SIUE, I completed my PhD in Information and Media at Michigan State University, where I studied gameplay livestreaming and how audiences build relationships with streamers. My master's degree in Speech Communication from SIUE examined parasocial relationships on social media platforms like Facebook.

## Research Interests

My current work explores:

- **Virtual Communication**: How people interact, experience fatigue, and find authentic connection in virtual meetings and VR spaces
- **Gaming & Media**: The psychology of gameplay, streaming, and how games shape communication and identity
- **Remote Work & Education**: Supporting wellbeing and equity in virtual classrooms and distributed teams
- **Data & Communication**: Using computational methods to understand media consumption and online behavior

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe the best research methods courses empower students to ask *good questions* before worrying about technical answers. This course is structured around the idea that you're a **Communication Liaison**—someone who bridges data science and creative thinking.

I'm committed to:
- Making research methods accessible (not just for math people)
- Using real data and meaningful projects
- Supporting diverse learning styles and backgrounds
- Building a collaborative, judgment-free classroom

- Improving equity and wellbeing in virtual classrooms
- Understanding play and professionalism in remote environments
