# UX & Navigation Improvement Plan
## MC Research Methods: The Liaison Program Website

**Last Updated:** January 20, 2026  
**Prepared By:** UX Expert Review

---

## Executive Summary

Your Liaison Program website has excellent foundational content but needs significant UX improvements to match research lab standards. Inspired by the SIM Lab website design (sim-lab-siue.github.io), this plan addresses:

1. **Navigation clarity** - Streamline multi-level menus
2. **Visual hierarchy** - Add research themes and visual appeal
3. **Accessibility** - Improve readability and navigation flow
4. **Information architecture** - Reorganize content for discovery
5. **Branding** - Create a cohesive research lab aesthetic

---

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths ✅
- Clean Quarto/Bootstrap framework
- Logical five-phase structure
- Good content organization (sidebar + navbar)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Search functionality
- Clear calls-to-action on home page

### Gaps & Issues ❌
- **Navigation overload**: Too many items in navbar (7 items + dropdown)
- **Unclear hierarchy**: Sidebar duplicates navbar; confusing for new users
- **Generic design**: Looks like a generic course site, not a research program
- **Missing context**: No research themes/focus areas like SIM Lab
- **Poor discoverability**: Phase content pages are empty/minimal
- **Mobile experience**: Sidebar navigation not optimized for phones
- **Visual identity**: No branding, icons, or visual differentiation
- **Internal links**: Not all modules have content; broken navigation paths
- **Contact info scattered**: About page isolated; no footer with contact info
- **No visual hierarchy on homepage**: Three buttons look the same; can't scan quickly

---

## Reference Site Analysis: SIM Lab (sim-lab-siue.github.io)

### Key Design Patterns
✅ **Homepage hero section** with lab introduction  
✅ **Research theme cards** - 3 distinct research areas with descriptions  
✅ **Clean navbar** - HOME | ABOUT | PROJECTS | (minimal)  
✅ **Footer with contact** - Email, office hours, social links  
✅ **Project pages** - Individual research projects with details  
✅ **Team/people section** - Director bio, lab members  
✅ **Visual branding** - Consistent colors, imagery, typography  
✅ **Mobile-first layout** - Content reflows well on small screens

## Detailed Improvement Recommendations

### SECTION 1: Information Architecture Redesign

#### 1.1 Flatten the Navigation Structure
**Current Problem:** Navbar has "Phases" dropdown + sidebar duplication  
**Impact:** Users don't know which nav to use; mobile nav breaks

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Remove sidebar navigation on mobile (or make collapsible only)
- [ ] Simplify navbar: `HOME | SYLLABUS | PHASES | RESOURCES | ABOUT`
- [ ] Keep "Phases" as a dropdown with 5 items
- [ ] Move "Vault Download" to Resources page (not navbar)
- [ ] Remove "Contact" from navbar; add to footer

**New Navbar Structure:**
```
HOME
├─ Index (Quick start)
├─ Setup Guide

SYLLABUS
├─ Course info, objectives, grading

PHASES (dropdown)
├─ Phase 1: Orientation
├─ Phase 2: Discovery
├─ Phase 3: The Dictionary
├─ Phase 4: Execution
├─ Phase 5: Delivery

RESOURCES
├─ Vault download
├─ Software tools
├─ Setup guides
├─ Templates

ABOUT
├─ Instructor bio
├─ Lab info
├─ Contact
```

#### 1.2 Reorganize Sidebar Content
**Current Problem:** Sidebar lists every page; creates cognitive overload  
**Impact:** Users scroll forever; key pages hidden

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create distinct sidebar sections for each phase
- [ ] Collapse phases by default on mobile
- [ ] Show expanded current phase only
- [ ] Add visual indicators (icons) for each phase
- [ ] Keep "Start Here" section always visible

---

### SECTION 2: Homepage Redesign

#### 2.1 Hero Section with Visual Impact
**Current Problem:** Homepage is text-heavy; no visual anchors  
**Impact:** Users don't immediately understand the program value

**Changes:**
- [ ] Add a hero banner with course title + tagline
- [ ] Include an optional hero image (lab photo, abstract design)
- [ ] Create a concise 1-2 sentence tagline about the liaison role
- [ ] Replace three button CTA with visual grid of four key actions:

**Proposed Homepage Grid:**
```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│ 📋 GET STARTED   │ 🎯 THE 5 PHASES  │
│ Complete setup   │ View course flow │
│ [Setup Guide]    │ [Phases]         │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ 📚 RESOURCES     │ 👤 MEET DR. L    │
│ Vault + tools    │ Instructor info  │
│ [Downloads]      │ [About]          │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

#### 2.2 Add Program Overview Section
**Current Problem:** Home page jumps to phases without explaining context  
**Impact:** New students don't understand why this matters

**Changes:**
- [ ] Add section: "Your Role as a Communication Liaison"
- [ ] Explain 3 key competencies you'll develop
- [ ] Show typical career paths or applications
- [ ] Include a visual timeline/roadmap of 5 phases

#### 2.3 Visual Differentiation of Call-to-Actions
**Current Problem:** All buttons look similar; no priority hierarchy  
**Impact:** Users unsure what to do first

**Changes:**
- [ ] Primary CTA: "Get Started" (bright color, prominent)
- [ ] Secondary CTAs: "View Syllabus", "Download Vault", "About"
- [ ] Use badges/labels: "Quick (10 min)", "Download", etc.

---

### SECTION 3: Visual Design & Branding

#### 3.1 Add Lab Branding Elements
**Current Problem:** No visual identity; looks generic  
**Impact:** Doesn't feel like a professional research program

**Changes:**
- [ ] Create a lab name/identifier in header (e.g., "MC Research Methods Lab" or "The Liaison Lab")
- [ ] Add a lab logo or icon (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Create a color scheme inspired by your university branding
- [ ] Use consistent typography for headings

**Implementation in _quarto.yml:**
```yaml
website:
  title: "MC Research Methods: The Liaison Program"
  navbar:
    logo: "images/lab-logo.png"  # Optional
    background: "#2c5aa0"  # University brand color
    
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: custom-styling.scss
```

#### 3.2 Add Icons & Visual Indicators
**Current Problem:** Text-only navigation is boring  
**Impact:** Harder to scan; less engaging

**Changes:**
- [ ] Add phase icons (🧭 Orientation, 🔍 Discovery, 📖 Dictionary, ⚙️ Execution, 🎯 Delivery)
- [ ] Add icons to navbar items
- [ ] Use icons in phase index pages
- [ ] Create visual cards for resources instead of plain lists

#### 3.3 Improve Typography & Spacing
**Current Problem:** Dense text blocks; hard to read  
**Impact:** Reduced engagement

**Changes:**
- [ ] Increase line height (1.8 for body text)
- [ ] Add more whitespace between sections
- [ ] Use color for emphasis (highlights, callout boxes)
- [ ] Create visual hierarchy: H1 > H2 > H3 with distinct sizes

### SECTION 4: Phase Pages Enhancement

├─ What to submit
├─ Due date
└─ How you'll be evaluated

🔗 NAVIGATION
← Previous Phase | Next Phase →
```

- [ ] Make footer nav sticky on mobile
- [ ] Add progress indicator (e.g., "Phase 2 of 5")
