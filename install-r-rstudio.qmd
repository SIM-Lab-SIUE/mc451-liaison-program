## Why R & RStudio?

R is the industry standard for statistical analysis, data visualization, and reproducible research in mass communications. RStudio is the professional interface that makes R accessible and powerful. Together, they're essential tools for any Communication Liaison who works with data.

In this course, you'll use R to:
- Clean and analyze data from surveys and content analysis
- Create publication-ready visualizations and reports
- Build reproducible workflows for your research
- Collaborate on data analysis projects

## What You'll Install

1. **R** — The programming language (free, open-source)
2. **RStudio** — The professional development environment (free, open-source)

This is a two-step process: install R first, then RStudio.

---

## Step 1: Install R

### For Windows

1. Go to [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Click **"Download R"** in the left menu
3. Click the **"Download R for Windows"** link
4. Click **"base"**
5. Click **"Download R X.X.X for Windows"** (where X.X.X is the latest version number)
6. Run the installer (`.exe` file)
   - Click "Next" through all screens
   - Accept the default installation location
   - Accept all default components
7. Click "Finish"

**To verify installation:**

1. Go to [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Click **"Download R"** in the left menu
3. Click **"Download R for macOS"**
4. Download the appropriate `.pkg` file for your Mac:
   - **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 chips)**: Download the "ARM64" version
   - **Intel Macs**: Download the "Intel 64" version
   - Not sure? Click the Apple icon (top left) → **"About This Mac"** → check under "Processor"
5. Run the installer (`.pkg` file)
   - Click through all prompts
   - Accept the default installation location
6. Restart your Mac

**To verify installation:**
- Open Terminal
- Type `R --version`
- You should see R's version information

### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install r-base
```

To verify: Type `R --version` in Terminal.

## Step 2: Install RStudio

### For Windows, macOS, or Linux

1. Go to [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
2. Scroll down to **"All Installers"** or **"Download RStudio Desktop"**
3. Select your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Download the `.exe` file
   - **macOS**: Download the `.dmg` file
   - **Linux**: Download the appropriate `.deb` or `.rpm` file
4. Run the installer
   - Windows: Click through all default options
   - Mac: Drag RStudio to Applications folder
   - Linux: Follow the package manager prompts
5. Open RStudio (you should see R is installed when you open it)

---

## Step 3: Verify RStudio Works

1. **Open RStudio** (should be in your Applications/Programs menu)
2. You should see four panes:
   - **Top left**: Script editor (blank)
   - **Bottom left**: Console (shows `>` prompt)
   - **Top right**: Environment & History
   - **Bottom right**: Files, Plots, Packages, Help

3. In the **Console** (bottom left), type this command and press Enter:

```r
print("Hello, Communication Liaison!")
```

4. You should see the output:
```
[1] "Hello, Communication Liaison!"
```

If you see this output, **you're ready to go!**

---

## Step 4: Install Key Packages

RStudio comes with base R, but you'll need additional packages for data analysis. Open RStudio and copy these commands into the Console one at a time:

### For Data Analysis & Visualization

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This installs a collection of packages including:
- **ggplot2** — Create professional visualizations
- **dplyr** — Clean and transform data
- **readr** — Import data from CSV, Excel, etc.
- **tidyr** — Reshape data

**Wait for it to finish** (you'll see a blank `>` prompt when done)

### For Survey Analysis

```r
install.packages("likert")
```

Used for analyzing Likert-scale survey responses.

### For Reporting

```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Creates professional PDF and HTML reports from your analysis.

### Optional: Statistics Packages

For later phases, you might want these too:

```r
install.packages("lm.beta")  # Standardized regression coefficients
install.packages("car")       # Post-hoc tests and diagnostics
install.packages("ggstatsplot")  # Statistical plots with test results
```

---

## Step 5: Create Your First R Project

RStudio projects help you organize your work. Let's create one:

1. In RStudio, click **File** → **New Project**
2. Select **New Directory** → **New Project**
3. Name your project `mc451-research` or similar
4. Choose where to save it (suggest `Documents`)
5. Click **Create Project**

You should now see your project name in the top-right corner of RStudio.

---

## Step 6: Test Your Setup with Data

Let's make sure everything works by loading a dataset:

In the Console, type:

```r
# Load the tidyverse library
library(tidyverse)

# Load a built-in dataset
data(mtcars)

# View the first few rows
head(mtcars)
```

You should see a table with car data. If this works, your R setup is complete!

## Understanding the RStudio Interface

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Top Left (Script Editor)** | Write R code here and save as `.R` files |
| **Bottom Left (Console)** | Results appear here; you can type commands directly |
| **Top Right (Environment)** | Shows all variables and data you've loaded |
| **Bottom Right (Files/Plots/Help)** | Navigate files, view plots, access documentation |

---

## Basic RStudio Workflow

1. **Create a new script**: File → New File → R Script
2. **Write code**: Type your commands in the script
3. **Run code**: Select lines and press **Ctrl+Enter** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Enter** (Mac)
4. **See results**: Output appears in the Console or Plots pane
5. **Save your work**: **Ctrl+S** or File → Save

## Common First-Time Issues

### "Command not found: R"

**Problem**: Your computer doesn't recognize the R command.

**Solution**:
- Try restarting your computer after installation
- Check that R installed correctly (reinstall if needed)
- On Mac/Linux, you may need to use `/usr/bin/R` instead

### RStudio Opens But Doesn't Find R

**Problem**: RStudio says "R not found" when you open it.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you installed R first (before RStudio)
2. In RStudio, go to **Tools** → **Global Options** → **General**
3. Under "R sessions", check the "R home directory"
4. If empty, browse to your R installation folder and select it
5. Click "OK"

### "Error: Could not find function"

**Problem**: You get an error like `could not find function "ggplot"`

**Solution**: You need to load the package first. Run:
```r
library(ggplot2)  # or whichever package you need
```

### Installation Stuck or Takes Forever

**Problem**: `install.packages()` command seems frozen.

**Solution**:
1. Press **Escape** to stop it
2. Try installing from a different CRAN mirror:
```r
install.packages("tidyverse", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")
```

### "Permission denied" Error (Mac/Linux)

**Problem**: Error when installing packages.

**Solution**: Try:
```r
Sys.which("R")  # Check where R is installed
```

If you're still stuck, reach out during office hours.
